Code that solves the "combination" problem. 

Example: There are 12 players on a basketball team, and only 5 players can play at any one time.
How many combinations of 5 players can be made with all 12 team members? The formula for this is:

x = 5! (factorial of the sub group)
y = 12! (factorial of the total group)
z = 7! (factorial of the total - sub)

 y
____   =  Number of unique combinations
x * z
